    <h1>New Relic Ruby Kata</h1>
    <p>Code Kata is a term coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=020161622X&linkCode=as2&tag=alveleschpta-20">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> in a nod to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.</p>
    <p>The goal of this Kata is to get your mind wired into performance driven development, to reinforce your skills as a user of <a href="http://newrelic.com">New Relic</a> and to help you get more familiar with <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.</p>
    <p>Of course the code in some areas of this application is intentionally bad, but what fun would this be if everything worked the way it should?</p>
